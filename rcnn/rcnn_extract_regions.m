% [batches, batch_padding] = rcnn_extract_regions(im, boxes, rcnn_model)
%   Extract image regions and preprocess them for use in Caffe.
%   Output is a cell array of batches.
%   Each batch is a 4-D tensor formatted for input into Caffe:
%     - BGR channel order
%     - single precision
%     - mean subtracted
%     - dimensions from fastest to slowest: width, height, channel, batch_index
%
%   im is an image in RGB order as returned by imread
%   boxes are in [x1 y1 x2 y2] format with one box per row
